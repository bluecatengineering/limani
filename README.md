# @bluecateng/limani

## Getting started

Limani is a React component library which consists of Gateway shared react components.

These components are expected to only work with Gateway.

## Prerequisites

-   Make sure to use this package along with `@bluecateng/pelagos`. Installing `@bluecateng/limani` will automatically install `@bluecateng/pelagos` as it is a peer dependency of Limani.
-   When using Limani we depend on components from `@bluecateng/pelagos`. For proper CSS to be applied for the component please make sure to add the following in your main Less style sheet file

    ```
    @import '~@bluecateng/pelagos/less/core';
    @import '~@bluecateng/pelagos/less/inputs';
    @import '~@bluecateng/pelagos/less/themes';

    // data-theme attribute must be set on the html tag
    [data-theme='light'] {
      .theme-light();
    }

    [data-theme='dark'] {
      .theme-dark();
    }
    ```

## How to use Limani

```
# Install the limani package
npm install @bluecateng/limani

# Import components
import { FormLayout } from '@bluecateng/limani'
```
