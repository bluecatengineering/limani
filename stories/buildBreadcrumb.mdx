# buildBreadcrumb

A breadcrumb shows the user their current location and how to navigate back to the main content. <br />
In cases where breadcrumb does not want to be displayed, the title shouldn't be passed in the
`SimplePage`. The title can be inside the `SimplePage` with `<h1>Title</h1>` tag.

## Parameters

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Param</th>
            <th>Type</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>title</td>
            <td>`string`</td>
            <td>Title to display on the page</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>items</td>
            <td>`Array.<object>`</td>
            <td>It is list of objects and each object represents a child in the navigation.</td>
        </tr>

## Returns

Return a breadcrumbs that shows the user's current location and the path they took to get there

## Example 1

`includeHome` is a parameter that determines whether to contain `Home` as a part of the navigation options <br />
By default, `includeHome` is `true`, so Home is the first navigation option.

```js
import { buildBreadcrumb, SimplePage } from '@bluecateng/limani';

function App() {
    return (
        <SimplePage>
            {buildBreadcrumb('Monitors', [
                { title: 'Computers', href: '/electronics/computers' },
            ])}
        </SimplePage>
    );
}
```

## Example 2

`includeHome` is `false`, so Home is not contained as a part of the navigation options.

```js
import { buildBreadcrumb, SimplePage } from '@bluecateng/limani';

function App() {
    return (
        <SimplePage>
            {buildBreadcrumb(
                'Monitors',
                [{ title: 'Computers', href: '/electronics/computers' }],
                false,
            )}
        </SimplePage>
    );
}
```
