# usePlatformData

Provides PlatformData context that contains platform data which is used by the `Header` component and also returns the `isFetchingData` and `triggerFetchData` properties which can be used to re-trigger fetching of platform data and check if it is still fetching data from the server.

## Returns

`usePlatformData~Return` - Returns a platformData context with platform `data` and the `isFetchingData`, `triggerFetchData` properties.

## Example

Obtains data and a toggle function for fetching data from `usePlatformData`

```js
import { Button, LabelLine } from '@bluecateng/pelagos';
import { SimplePage, usePlatformData } from '@bluecateng/limani';

function Example() {
    const { data, isFetchingData, triggerFetchData } = usePlatformData();

    const handleButtonClick = () => {
        console.log('Current username: ', data.user.username);
        triggerFetchData();
    };
    return (
        <>
            <Button text='Get name' onClick={handleButtonClick} />
            {!isFetchingData && <LabelLine text='Here is an example!' />}
        </>
    );
}

export default function App() {
    return (
        <SimplePage>
            <Example />
        </SimplePage>
    );
}
```
