# Achieving a standard form layout

A standard layout for forms consists of the form fields above a row of buttons
for actions about the form. The buttons are always displayed and a placed at the
bottom of the parent element, which is expanded vertically to fill the allowed
height, depending on its container. In case the fields take more vertical space
that is container by the "form", then a scrollbar appears. The buttons are never
part of the scrolled content.

Achieving the arrangement described above is possible through some of the
components in this library. Nonetheless, as a pattern it is not limited to them.
Hence, the following LESS variables can be used in the styles of the elements
involved in such a layout.

## LESS variables

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Variable</th>
            <th>Target for application</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>`layout-form`</td>
            <td>The wrapping container, usually the `<form>`</td>
            <td>
                Sets the layout model for the element to be `flexbox`.
                This is required for the other styles to work.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>`layout-form-fields`</td>
            <td>The contained element, whose children are the fields of the form.</td>
            <td>
                The element will expand to fill the available vertical space.
                In case of insufficient height, the overflow is reachable through
                a scrollbar.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>`layout-form-buttons`</td>
            <td>The contained element, that should be positioned as "buttons".</td>
            <td>
                The element will be always visible and renderd at the lower end
                of its parent container.
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## Example

The following example focused on the documented LESS utilities. It does not
represent the recommended patterns to handle form state or build whole pages.

```css
import '~@bluecateng/limani/less/layout-form.less';

.App_form {
    @layout-form();
}

.App_fields {
    @layout-form-fields();
}

.App_buttons {
    @layout-form-buttons();
}
```

```js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Button, TextInputField } from '@bluecateng/pelagos';

function App() {
    const [username, setUsername] = useState('');
    const [password, setPassword] = useState('');

    const handleCancel = () => {
        /* Implementation */
    };
    const handleSave = () => {
        /* Implementation */
    };

    return (
        <div className='App_form'>
            <div className='App_fields'>
                <TextInputField
                    label='Username'
                    type='text'
                    name='username'
                    value={username}
                    onChange={(value) => setUsername(value)}
                />
                <TextInputField
                    label='Password'
                    type='password'
                    name='password'
                    value={password}
                    onChange={(value) => setPassword(value)}
                />
            </div>
            <div className='App_buttons'>
                <Button text='Cancel' onClick={handleCancel} />
                <Button text='Save' onClick={handleSave} />
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```
