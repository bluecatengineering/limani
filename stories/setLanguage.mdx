<Meta title='functions/setLanguage' />

# setLanguage

Sets the language for Limani. The default language is set to English i.e. `en`.
There is no need to call this function unless the selected
language is other than `en`. This function should be called as early as
possible, and wait before rendering the components,as it's an asynchronous operation.
Currently only `en` is supported.

## Parameters

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Param</th>
            <th>Type</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>language</td>
            <td>`String`</td>
            <td>The language that needs to be set.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## Returns

`Promise` - Resolves successfully on language change.

## Example

```js
import { setLanguage } from '@bluecateng/limani';

const Example = () => (
    setLanguage('es').catch((error) => {
        // handle error
    })
    ...
);
```
